## File Structure

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Landing page HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js                # Express server (modified to serve static files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sheets.js               # Google Sheets integration

```

## Server Configuration

The Express server has been updated to:

1. **Serve Static Files**: Added `express.static('public')` middleware
2. **Root Route**: Added route to serve the landing page at `/`
3. **Webhook Endpoint**: Maintains the existing `/webhook` endpoint for form submissions

## Testing Mode

For testing purposes, the Google Sheets integration has been temporarily disabled. Form submissions are logged to the console instead of being sent to Google Sheets.

To re-enable Google Sheets integration:

1. Uncomment the Google Sheets import in `index.js`
2. Uncomment the Google Sheets functionality in the webhook endpoint
3. Set up the required environment variables in `.env`

## Environment Variables

To enable full functionality, you'll need these environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=your_sheet_id
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

## Browser Compatibility

The landing page is compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized CSS and minimal JavaScript
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML
- **Accessible**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Content**: Update the legal firm name, contact information, and messaging
2. **Add Analytics**: Integrate Google Analytics or other tracking tools
3. **Enable Google Sheets**: Set up environment variables and re-enable Google Sheets integration
4. **Add SSL**: Configure HTTPS for production deployment
